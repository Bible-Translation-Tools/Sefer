 *   * `<namespace>.v`                     which variant is showing
 *   * `<namespace>.<tweak>`               a tweak that applies to every variant
 *   * `<namespace>.<variant>.<tweak>`     a tweak belonging to one variant
 *
 * A value sitting at its declared default is REMOVED rather than written. A
 * link carrying every default is one nobody can see the interesting part of,
