/**
 * Turning the element under the cursor into something a reader can find again.
 *
 * In order of usefulness:
 *
 *   1. `data-loc` — the file, line and column the markup was written at, put
 *      there by the JSX-location Vite transform. This is the whole point. A
 *      comment carrying `src/app/ui/review/DecisionRow.tsx:42` is a place to
 *      go; one carrying `.flex.items-center.gap-2` is a grep.
 *   2. A short CSS-ish path, for a project without that transform — this
 *      module must still be useful when dropped somewhere that has not set one
 *      up.
 *   3. The visible text nearby, because "the Find Project card" is how a
 *      person will describe it anyway.
