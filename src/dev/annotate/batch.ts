/**
 * The batch of comments, where it is kept, and what it looks like on the

 *
 * ## Storage
 *
 * `sessionStorage`, so a hot reload does not eat ten minutes of writing. Per
 * tab, which is right: two tabs are two things being reviewed.
 *
 * ## Copy clears, but softly
 *
 * Copying empties the active list — stale comments getting pasted a second
 * time is the worse failure, and the one that wastes somebody else's time. But
 * the batch is kept as `last`, and the panel offers to bring it back, because
 * losing a morning's notes to a misclicked button is a close second.
 *
 * ## Markdown, not JSON
 *
 * The destination is a chat box. Two verbosity levels, because three is a menu
 * nobody reads: `brief` is the URL, the build, and then a source location and
 * the words per comment — most comments are "this padding is wrong" and the
 * location IS the payload. `full` adds viewport, theme, selector and the
 * nearby text for the ones where the words are not enough.
