/**
 * Point and prompt: a floating panel that drives a prototype's variants and
 * tweaks, and turns "this padding is wrong" into something an agent can act on.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const annotator = mountAnnotator({
 *   namespace: "onboarding",
 *   variants: [{ id: "a", label: "Cards", tweaks: [...] }, { id: "b", label: "Table" }],
 *   tweaks: [{ key: "density", label: "Density", kind: "choice", options: ["cosy", "tight"] }],
 *   state: { read: () => search(), write: (next) => navigate({ search: next }) },
 *   context: () => ({ build: buildId }),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Everything about it is a corner of the screen and a `StateAdapter`. It knows
 * nothing about Solid, about the router, or about Sefer — `pnpm boundaries`
 * runs `src/core`'s rule set over this folder, so an accidental `solid-js`
 * import fails the build rather than quietly welding the tool to one app.
 *
 * ## The two modes
 *
 * `interact` is the application, untouched. `comment` takes every event in the
 * CAPTURE phase, so while it is on the application cannot be operated at all —
 * a click selects the element under the pointer instead of pressing it. A
 * half-mode where some clicks fall through is how somebody ends up filing a
 * bug about the app being broken, so the mode is total, loudly signposted (a
 * crosshair and a tinted viewport edge), and `Escape` always leaves it.
 *
 * ## What a comment carries
 *
 * The `data-loc` stamp from the JSX-location transform, when one is running —
 * that is the difference between a note an agent can act on and a note it has
 * to grep for. Without it, a short selector and the nearby words, so this
 * module is still useful dropped into a project that has not set that up.
 *
 * ## One sentence, several places
 *
 * A plain click comments on what is under it. SHIFT+click collects the element
 * and waits, so the next plain click opens one composer holding all of them.
 * "These two should swap" and "move 1 to where 2 is" are among the most natural
 * things to say about a layout, and before this they cost two comments that
 * each described half a thought.
 *
 * Every collected place gets a number, painted on a pin over the element and
 * printed as `[2]` in the paste. The same number in both is the whole point:
 * it is what lets the sentence refer to them.
